# Copy Link

A Chrome extension that builds a link to the current page being viewed in
your browser and copies it to the clipboard.

The options page allows you to select from the following link formats:
* Markdown
* HTML &lt;a&gt; element
* XML &lt;site&gt; element

By default, the page title is used as the display text for the link. You can
override this behavior by selecting a text string within the document: that
string will then be used as the display text instead of the page title.

When you press the Copy Link button, the extension copies the formatted link to
the clipboard, which you can then paste into a wiki page or other document.

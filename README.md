# Copy Link

A Chrome extension that builds a link to the current page being viewed in
your browser and copies it to the clipboard.

The options page allows you to select from the following link formats:
* Markdown
* HTML
* XML &lt;site&gt; element

By default, the page title is used as the display text for the link. You can
override this behavior by selecting a text string within the document.

When you press the Copy Link button, the extension copies the formatted link to
the clipboard, which you can then paste into a wiki page or other document.

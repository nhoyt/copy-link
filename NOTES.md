## Documentation Notes

### Version 2.x

_Brief Description:_

Creates link markup for the current page in the selected format and copies it to the clipboard for pasting into another document.

_Detailed Description:_

Copy Page Link creates a formatted link to the current page and copies it to the clipboard. Once copied, it can be pasted elsewhere using the standard keyboard shortcuts or menu actions for Paste.

The formatted link consists of two main items: (1) the descriptive link text and (2) the URL of the page. By default, the page title is used as the link text. However, if there is a text selection on the web page, Copy Page Link will use it as the link text instead of the page title.

The Copy Page Link preferences/options page provides four choices for link format: Markdown (the default), HTML, LaTeX and XML. It also allows you to specify the element and attribute names for the XML format.

### Version 1.x

_Brief Description:_

Inserts the title and URL of the current page into the preferred link format, and copies the result to the clipboard, for pasting into an external document. If text is selected on the page, the selection is used in place of the page title.

_Detailed Description:_

The Copy Page Link add-on copies a formatted link to the page currently being viewed in the active tab. Once copied, it can be pasted from the clipboard using standard keyboard shortcuts such as ctrl-v or cmd-v, or by selecting Paste from an Edit or context menu.

The four link formats currently supported are:

* Markdown
* HTML
* LaTeX
* XML

To use the XML format, you will typically want to configure the names of the XML elements and attributes on the add-on's options page.

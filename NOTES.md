## Documentation Notes

### Version 2.x

Copy Page Link creates a formatted link to the current page and copies it to the clipboard. The preferences page provides four choices for link format:

<ul>
<li>Markdown (default)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>
The formatted link consists of (1) the descriptive link text and (2) the URL of the page. By default, the <em>page title</em> is used as the link text. However, if there is a <em>text selection</em> on the web page, Copy Page Link will use it as the link text <em>instead of</em> the page title.

### Version 1.x

The Copy Page Link add-on copies a formatted link to the page currently being viewed in the active tab. Once copied, it can be pasted from the clipboard using standard keyboard shortcuts such as ctrl-v or cmd-v, or by selecting Paste from an Edit or context menu.

The four link formats currently supported are:

* Markdown
* HTML
* LaTeX
* XML

To use the XML format, you will typically want to configure the names of the XML elements and attributes on the add-on's options page.
